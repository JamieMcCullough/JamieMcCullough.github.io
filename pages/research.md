<h1>What is Weak Gravitational Lensing?</h1>
<img src="{{site.urlimg}}weak_lensing_blender.gif" width=500px height=auto>
Gravitational lensing is what we call the distortion of light around massive structures as it travels through the curved spacetime that mass imparts. The most dramatic distortions happen around incredibly massive galaxy clusters and halos (see the example visuals <a href="{{site.url}}visualization/figures/">here</a>). _Weak_ gravitational lensing uses the tiny distortions (~1% change in shape) of millions (and soon billions) of galaxy shapes to trace the large-scale structure of the universe. Most of that structure comes from dark matter, which outnumbers ordinary matter 5 to 1, and so it is invisible to our eyes and telescopes. Lensing indirectly traces the gravitational impact of these massive cosmic filaments and tells us about the nature of dark matter, dark energy, and the structure of the universe over cosmic time.<br>

<h2>How do we get distances to extragalactic sources?</h2>
<img src="{{site.urlimg}}balmer_break_grizy.gif" width=500px height=auto>
For very distant objects, we can estimate their distances according to the shifts in the frequency of light for known atomic transitions. Stars inside galaxies have characteristic light curves (spectral energy distributions) that depend on their composition and age, and galaxies similarly are large coalitions of stars. Distant galaxies, due to the expansion of the universe, are moving away from us. More distant galaxies are moving away from us with a faster relative velocity. This imparts an observed _redshift_ to the light emitted from that galaxy when observed by us. If we use spectroscopy to observe these atomic transitions, we can calculate exactly how fast the galaxy is receding, which is directly related to its distance.<br>
The difficulty astronomers face with distance estimation, is that it takes a very long time on existing telescopes to measure the spectral energy distributions of galaxies. To estimate distances properly, we want to characterize the relationship between galaxy _colors_, which can be measured from taking images in several filters, and galaxy _redshift_, which we can obtain from sparser spectroscopic surveys. For certain phenotypes of galaxies, this is straightforward (like the depiction above). But there are many different kinds of galaxies and performing this inference can require complex algorithms and carefully chosen spectroscopic data.

Galaxies on a large scale seem to be distributed uniformly, but on smaller scales get bound up into what is generally called "large scale structure" â€”enormous filaments of matter that have clumped together as the Universe evolves ... </blockquote></p><p style="text-align:center"><a class="radius button small" href="https://kipac.stanford.edu/highlights/how-tease-out-tiniest-distortions-galaxy-shapes-probe-secrets-universe">Read more</a></p>
