I did my PhD in physics at Stanford University and Ludwig Maximilians Universitaet Muenchen (LMU), and my undergraduate degree in aerospace engineering at the University of Texas at Austin, with a minor in astronomy. My [research][1] uses the tiny distortions we see in galaxy shapes as tracers of massive cosmic structure to learn things about dark matter, dark energy, and the evolution history of our universe.
