I completed my PhD in physics at Stanford and Ludwig Maximilians Universitaet Muenchen (LMU), and my undergraduate degree in aerospace engineering at the University of Texas at Austin, with a minor in astronomy. My [research][1] uses the tiny distortions we see in galaxy shapes as tracers of <strong>massive cosmic structure</strong> to learn things about <strong>dark matter, dark energy</strong>, and the <strong>expansion history of our universe</strong>.
