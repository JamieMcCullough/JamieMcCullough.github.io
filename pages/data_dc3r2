## Abstract
We present initial results from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Complete Calibration of the Color-Redshift
Relation (DC3R2) secondary target survey. Our analysis uses 230k galaxies that overlap with KiDS-VIKING _ugriZYHJKs_
photometry to calibrate the color-redshift relation and to inform photometric redshift (photo-z) inference methods of future
weak lensing surveys. Together with Emission Line Galaxies (ELGs), Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs), and the Bright Galaxy
Survey (BGS) that provide samples of complementary color, the DC3R2 targets help DESI to span 56% of the color space
visible to Euclid and LSST with high confidence spectroscopic redshifts. The effects of spectroscopic completeness and quality
are explored, as well as systematic uncertainties introduced with the use of common Self Organizing Maps trained on different
photometry than the analysis sample. We further examine the dependence of redshift on magnitude at fixed color, important
for the use of bright galaxy spectra to calibrate redshifts in a fainter photometric galaxy sample. We find that noise in the
KiDS-VIKING photometry introduces a dominant, apparent magnitude dependence of redshift at fixed color, which indicates a
need for carefully chosen deep drilling fields, and survey simulation to model this effect for future weak lensing surveys.
